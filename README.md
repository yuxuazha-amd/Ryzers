# Ryzen AI Robotics, Vision and ML Dockerfiles

This repository provides a collection of composable Dockerfiles and build scripts for deploying and running software, full applications, and select demonstrators on AMD Ryzen AI hardware. The project is designed to streamline the setup of AI workloads, robotics, vision, and other applications optimized for Ryzen AI.

---

## Overview

Ryzers is a modular framework for building and running Docker containers tailored for AMD Ryzen AI hardware. It supports a wide range of applications, including machine learning, robotics, vision, and more. The repository is structured to allow easy composition of Dockerfiles, enabling users to build custom containers for their specific needs.

These dockerfiles will also be pushed and actively maintained in their original repository homes whenever possible.  Ryzers will be a collection point of software frameworks to run on AMD hardware.  We are committed to open-source and happy to accept contributions or feedback on packages hosted here.
